--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auto Care Hub is a robust full-stack web application designed to digitize the workflow of a premium automotive performance center. Built with a Node.js and Express backend coupled with a MySQL relational database, this project bridges the gap between vehicle owners and service administrators through a responsive and interactive interface.

Key Features:

For Drivers (User Module):

Digital Garage: Users can register and manage multiple vehicles with specific details (Brand, Model, Plate) saved to the database.

Smart Booking: An interactive appointment form allows users to select specific cars from their garage and choose multiple services (e.g., Periodic Maintenance, Dyno Test). The system performs real-time price calculation based on selected services.

Live Tracking: A visual timeline enables users to track their service status (Pending → Approved → Completed) instantly.

For Management (Admin Panel):

Operational Control: A secure dashboard for administrators to view, approve, or cancel incoming appointment requests.

Analytics: Real-time calculation of estimated revenue, completed jobs, and pending approvals.

Workflow Integration: Actions taken in the admin panel (e.g., marking a job as "Completed") instantly update the user's timeline and archive the job.

Technical Stack:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap 5 & Custom Dark Mode), Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).

Backend: Node.js, Express.js (RESTful API architecture).

Database: MySQL (Structured relational data for Users, Vehicles, and Appointments).

This project demonstrates proficiency in CRUD operations, database schema design, and full-stack state management.
